# Linux Installation Party 2015

A yearly event by CeSIUM where Linux is not only introduced to the new students but also installed on their computers.

This is the presentation to be used based on the one done in 2014, this time around built on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

It will soon be available [here](http://cesium.github.io/lip15).
